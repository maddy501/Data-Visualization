=># **RockingRobin**: 
Rocking Robin is a virtual ice cream chain across the whole United States.The dataset used for this visualization was taken from the internet.Top down approach has been used when creating this visualization. The whole dahboard is highly interactive and is divided as mentioned below. 

1- The top visualization is used to display the overall summary of the business across the whole USA. This helps the business stake holders to see the finances such as total sales, total profit, total expenses etc  upfront.

2- The second visualization illustrates the business distrbution across the whole United States. The color coding of the map is done to display the differences of profit earned in which state. The highest one being in California. Further more upon hovering over each state tool tip is displayed which displays important infomation such as budget sales, budget profit etc. 

3- The second graph shows the trend in sales, profit and budget sales using a line graph through the year. Legends has been added so the user know what information each line displays.
