# Data-Visualization
The following repository contains different type of visualizations made using Tableau software. Below are some of the visualization made by me: 


=> **RockingRobin**: 
Rocking Robin is a virtual ice cream chain across the whole United States.The dataset used for this visualization was taken from the internet.Top down approach has been used when creating this visualization. The whole dashboard is highly interactive and is divided as mentioned below. 

1- The top visualization is used to display the overall summary of the business across the whole USA. This helps the business stake holders to view the finances such as total sales, total profit, total expenses etc  upfront.

2- The second visualization illustrates the business distrbution across the whole United States. The color coding of the map is done to display the differences of profit earned in each state. The highest one being in California. Further more upon hovering over each state tool tip is displayed which displays important infomation such as budget sales, budget profit etc for that state. 

3- The second graph shows the trend in sales, profit and budget sales using a line graph through out the year. Legends has been added so the user knows what information each line displays.

4- Furthermore tabular representation is used to display additional information about the company's product.  The table content is clickable and upon click the other graph display information based on the selection. 

5- Lastyl bar graph is used to compare the profit and sales of Company's each product. The helps the user to understand which is the highest selling product and which items needs more attension to increase it's sale.

=> **Visualising the Pedestrian Count during COVID 19 restriction**:
The visualization was created for the Melbourne City council to understand the pedestrian count across the whole melbourne during COVID restriction. There are 23 sensors installed by the melbourne council at various places in melbourne which counts the pedestrian walking past that sensor. The dataset used for this visualizaition is taken from https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Transport/Pedestrian-Counting-System-Monthly-counts-per-hour/b2ak-trbp. The visualisation has been divided into Stage 2, Stage 3 and Stage 4 restirction. The map in each visualization shows the different location of the sensors and the intensity of the color illustrates the total pedestrian count in the area. Upon clicking on the sensor location the bar graph displays the houly trend for the particular area. This visualization will help for the city council to plan further restrictions in places where the pedestrian is still more during the lockdown. After COVID this visualization can be used for planning buses route to understand where the buses should travel from based on the number of pedestrian. Furthermore, marketing events can be planned based by looking which area is popular at what time of the day.
